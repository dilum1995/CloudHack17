# CloudHack17
CloudHack is a 24 our coding competion based on cloud computing technologies. and it was organized by IEEE student branch of University of Colombo School of Computing. This repository contaions our project that we developed during that coding competion within 24 hours. Actually our initial idea was to make a application which will help users to find loctions and the availabilty of a fashion product(T-Shirt) after the user take a picture of it using our application.

Actually this to develop this product we had to use some of the Microsoft vision APIs and Google Cloup platform as well as we used google vision API to improve the image recognition of our application.

As a team with four members we managed to developed a working prototype with all the core funtions within that 20 coding hours.
